# Building the Cosmic API: The Back-end Journey of Galactic Market

At the heart of our Galactic Market web application lies a robust and scalable back-end architecture, meticulously designed to handle the complexities of our celestial art platform. In this blog post, we'll delve into the intricate details of our back-end development process, highlighting the technologies and components that power our cosmic API.

## Choosing the Right Tools

To build a solid foundation for our back-end system, we carefully selected a powerful tech stack that would enable us to create a reliable and efficient API. Our primary choices were:

1. **Node.js and Express.js**: We relied on Node.js and Express.js to create a robust and scalable server architecture, handling API requests and database interactions with ease. The combination of these technologies allowed us to build a high-performance back-end that could handle a large volume of traffic and data.

2. **PostgreSQL**: For our database needs, we chose PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable relational database management system. Its ability to handle complex queries and geospatial data made it an ideal choice for storing and managing our celestial artworks and their associated metadata. PostgreSQL's robust feature set and proven performance ensured that our application could efficiently store and retrieve data, even as our user base and content grew.

## Designing a Stellar Database

At the core of our application lies a meticulously designed database schema that not only stores our celestial artworks but also captures the intricate details and relationships between them. Our database design comprises the following key tables:

1. **Artworks**: This table stores the essential information about each artwork, including its title, description, artist, and a reference to the associated image file.

2. **Celestial Objects**: This table houses data about the celestial objects depicted in the artworks, such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters. It includes properties like object type, coordinates, and physical characteristics.

3. **Artwork-Object Mapping**: To facilitate the connection between artworks and their celestial subjects, we created a mapping table that establishes the many-to-many relationship between these two entities.

By carefully structuring our database, we ensured efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling us to deliver a rich and informative user experience within our application.

## Building a Cosmic API

To facilitate communication between our front-end and back-end components, we developed a robust API using Node.js and Express.js. Our API provides a RESTful interface that allows clients to interact with our application's core functionality. Here are some of the key endpoints we implemented:

1. **Artwork Management**: Our API exposes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting artworks, enabling seamless management of our virtual gallery.

2. **Celestial Object Queries**: We implemented endpoints that allow users to search and retrieve information about celestial objects based on various criteria, such as object type, coordinates, or physical properties.

3. **User Authentication**: Leveraging Firebase's authentication services, our API provides endpoints for user registration, login, and managing user sessions, ensuring a secure and personalized experience for our users.

4. **Artwork-Object Mapping**: To facilitate the connection between artworks and their celestial subjects, we created API endpoints that handle the creation, retrieval, and management of these mappings.

5. **Pagination and Filtering**: One of the key features of our API is the ability to fetch paginated and filtered data from the database. We implemented a function that retrieves data from the `paintings` table with pagination and filtering capabilities, utilizing the `pg` library to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

```javascript
const { Pool } = require("pg");
const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS,
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_DATABASE,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
});

const fetchFilteredData = async (limit, offset) => {
  try {
    const query = `SELECT * FROM paintings LIMIT $1 OFFSET $2`;
    const values = [limit, offset];
    const result = await pool.query(query, values);
    return result.rows;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching filtered data from database:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};

module.exports = { fetchFilteredData };
```

This function establishes a connection with the PostgreSQL database using the `pg` library and executes a SQL query that retrieves data from the `paintings` table with the specified `limit` and `offset` values for pagination. The retrieved data is then returned as an array of rows.

By adhering to RESTful principles and implementing robust error handling and validation mechanisms, our API ensures reliable and efficient communication between the various components of our application.

## Challenges and Solutions

Building a robust and scalable back-end system was not without its challenges. One of the most significant hurdles we faced was integrating the vast astronomical data we had sourced with our application's core functionality.

To overcome this challenge, we implemented a data ingestion pipeline that could seamlessly process and transform the raw data into a format suitable for our database schema. This involved parsing various file formats, handling astronomical coordinate systems, and ensuring data consistency and integrity.

Another challenge we encountered was optimizing our application's performance, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex queries. We addressed this by implementing caching mechanisms, database indexing, and query optimization techniques, ensuring that our application remained responsive and efficient, even under heavy load.

## Conclusion

Building the back-end infrastructure for Galactic Market has been an incredible learning experience. From designing a stellar database to developing a cosmic API, and from implementing data ingestion pipelines to optimizing performance, we've acquired invaluable skills and knowledge along the way.

Our back-end system is the foundation upon which our celestial art platform stands, enabling us to deliver a rich and immersive experience to our users. With a robust API, efficient database management, and a scalable architecture, we're confident that Galactic Market will continue to thrive and grow, allowing artists and art enthusiasts alike to explore the wonders of the cosmos.

As we look towards the future, we're excited to continue expanding and enhancing our back-end capabilities, implementing advanced features and integrations that will further elevate the Galactic Market experience.
